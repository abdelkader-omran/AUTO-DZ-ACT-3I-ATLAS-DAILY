🔗 Research Program Context (Final Scientific Declaration)

AUTO-DZ-ACT is an established scientific execution framework, formally archived through multiple canonical Zenodo records and referenced across peer-accessible research outputs.

This repository represents a finalized execution-level extension of the existing AUTO-DZ-ACT research program. It does not constitute an initial publication, a novel methodological proposal, nor a redefinition or expansion of the AUTO-DZ-ACT framework.

The scientific scope of this repository is strictly limited to execution and observation, providing updated daily observational timelines, datasets, and figures related to 3I/ATLAS, under formally declared structural constraints.

Canonical Zenodo Record Lineage

The AUTO-DZ-ACT framework has been previously established and archived through the following canonical Zenodo records, which collectively define the authoritative framework baseline:
	1.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18204071
	2.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18134257
	3.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18117231
	4.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18012859
	5.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17968772

These records constitute the foundational and citable corpus of the AUTO-DZ-ACT framework.
No novelty claim, theoretical priority claim, or framework alteration is made in the present repository.

Role of the Present Repository

The role of this repository is explicitly and exclusively execution-level, defined as follows:
	•	Delivery of updated execution outputs and daily observational extensions
	•	Reproducible observational timelines, datasets, and figures
	•	No modification, reinterpretation, or extension of the AUTO-DZ-ACT framework
	•	Full compliance with TRIZEL-BASELINE-v1.0.0

This repository functions as an operational execution node, not as a framework-defining or governance-defining entity.

⸻

Framework vs. Execution — Formal Distinction
	•	Framework (Established):
AUTO-DZ-ACT epistemic state model
(0/0, D0/DZ, DZ, ∞/∞)
— fully defined and archived in prior Zenodo records.
	•	Execution (Current Work):
Daily observational timeline analysis, execution-level datasets, and updated analytical figures for 3I/ATLAS.

⸻

Mandatory Scientific Assertion (Final)

AUTO-DZ-ACT is an established scientific execution framework supported by multiple archived Zenodo records.
This repository contributes execution-level observational updates only, operating under TRIZEL-BASELINE-v1.0.0.

⸻

⚠️ Authority Boundary Declaration (Final)

This repository operates strictly within the execution layer.
	•	It holds no governance authority
	•	It holds no constitutional or epistemic authority
	•	It defines no scientific theory, no epistemic law, and no framework novelty
	•	It makes no claims of foundational, classificatory, or authoritative primacy

All structural, organizational, and methodological references explicitly conform to TRIZEL-BASELINE-v1.0.0.
