## 🔗 Research Program Context

**AUTO-DZ-ACT is an ESTABLISHED scientific execution framework** with multiple archived Zenodo records.

This repository extends an existing, peer-referenced AUTO-DZ-ACT research program and does **not** represent an initial publication or a new framework proposal.

### Prior Canonical Zenodo Archives

The AUTO-DZ-ACT framework has been developed through multiple archived research outputs:

1. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18204071  
2. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18134257  
3. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18117231  
4. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18012859  
5. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17968772  

### Current Repository Role

- Updated execution + daily observational extension
- No redefinition of AUTO-DZ-ACT framework
- Execution layer only under **TRIZEL-BASELINE-v1.0.0**

### Framework vs Execution

- **Framework (Established):** AUTO-DZ-ACT epistemic state model (0/0, D0/DZ, DZ, ∞/∞)
- **Execution (Current Work):** Daily observational timeline analysis and updated figures

**Mandatory Assertion**

> AUTO-DZ-ACT is an established scientific execution framework with multiple archived Zenodo records.  
> This repository contributes updated observational execution only, under TRIZEL-BASELINE-v1.0.0.
